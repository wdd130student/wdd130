  <p>Hi, everyone! Let me introduce myself. I'm from Mexico City but I live in San Antonio, Texas. My husband and I moved from Utah, 6 months ago. We love living here because the weather is warmer than Utah and this city has plenty of fun activities.</p>
  <p>I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for almost 6 years, the same time I have lived in USA. Having been baptized was the best decision in my life for all the blessing that I have received. </p>
  <p>I love dogs, vegetarian food, puzzles and discovering new places with my awesome husband. I'm really excited to learn how to build a website and getting to know all of you! </p>
